# Sonos Toolkit for Alfred

<img src="../../assets/icon-sonos.png" alt="Sonos logo" width="128" height="128">

The Sonos Toolkit for Alfred offers a set of keywords that let you quickly interact with Sonos's [Mac app](https://support.sonos.com/s/downloads).

This extension doesn't support programmatic access to Sonos, like searching your music or configuring your system from within Alfred. For that kind of integration, try the [Alfred Sonos Controller](https://github.com/karimkaylani/alfred-sonoscontroller) by [Karim Kaylani](https://github.com/karimkaylani).
