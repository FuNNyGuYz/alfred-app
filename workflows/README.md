# Alfred Workflows

I have released two Alfred Workflows.

## [.New Cloud Documents](./new-cloud-documents/)

.new is a domain extension exclusively for performing new actions online: any act that leads to creation can have a quick and memorable .new shortcut associated with it.

This Alfred Workflow allows you to quickly create new cloud documents simply by invoking the 'new' keyword, a space, and then selecting from the list of available options.

## [Twitter Toolkit](./twitter-toolkit/)

The Twitter Toolkit for Alfred is a set of keywords that let you quickly interact with Twitter's website and [Mac app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id1482454543?mt=12&uo=4).

It makes it easy to quickly search and find your own content or the content of people you follow.
