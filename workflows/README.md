# Alfred Workflows

I have released two Alfred Workflows.

## [New Cloud Documents](./new-cloud-documents/)

.new is a domain extension exclusively for performing new actions online: any act that leads to creation can have a quick and memorable .new shortcut associated with it.

This Alfred Workflow allows you to quickly create new cloud documents simply by invoking the 'new' keyword, a space, and then selecting from the list of available options.
