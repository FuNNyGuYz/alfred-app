# .New Alfred Workflow
## dot-new-alfred-workflow

[.new](https://whats.new/) is a domain extension exclusively for performing new actions online: any act that leads to creation can have a quick and memorable .new shortcut associated with it.

This Alfred Workflow allows you to quickly create new cloud documents simply by invoking the 'new' keyword, a space, and then selecting from the list of available options.

## Installation

Download and unzip [this file](https://github.com/chrismessina/alfred-app/raw/master/workflows/New%20Cloud%20Documents/dot-new-alfred-workflow.zip). Double-click `dot-new-alfred-workflow.alfredworkflow` to install it.

You will need to be an Alfred [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) user to enable this workflow.

## Usage

Activate Alfred and type `new`. You can then select from a list of existing .new cloud documents (with a few bonuses thrown in):

## Customizing

You can add new services to the workflow simply by adding a new shortcut to the List Filter that includes a Title, Subtitle, and argument (i.e. the URL used to create a new document). An icon is optional, but preferable.
